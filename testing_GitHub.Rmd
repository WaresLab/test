# Test file

Here we are trying to see if the differences between mac and windows can be overcome by github! So I'm trying to write latitude °S things, and maybe some Hudson's stats, or accents like in Perú. And test code from the rmarkdown example

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
